# nametag-coding-challenge
Write a program that updates itself. Imagine that you have a program you’ve deployed to clients and you will periodically produce new versions. When a new version is produced, we want the deployed programs to be seamlessly replaced by a new version.

Please write what you consider to be production quality code, whatever that means to you. You may choose any common programming language you like (Go, Rust, or C++ would be good choices). Your program should reasonably be expected to work across common desktop operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux). If your scheme requires non-trivial server components, please write those as well.

As in real life, answers to clarifying questions may be elusive. If you have a question, write it down, and guess what you think our answer might be, and proceed as if that were the answer.
